## Dodge Game

  Simple Dodge Game created using Pygame. I initially intended on making a 2D game with the same character but I ended up changing my mind since a dodge game is much simpler for a beginner. I will continue to add more features on this game since this is not yet the final product.

## Features Soon:

* Add different projectiles to dodge
* Add levels with increasing difficulty
* Add a storyline but retain the square character

## Controls

* W to go up
* D to go right
* S to go down
* A to go left
